# Requirements Document

## Introduction

이 기능은 사용자가 음식 및 운동 관련 외부 API를 쉽게 등록하고 관리할 수 있는 시스템을 제공합니다. 사용자는 API 키를 안전하게 저장하고, 연결 상태를 확인하며, 여러 API 제공업체를 통합 관리할 수 있습니다. 시스템은 API 키의 유효성을 검증하고, 만료 알림을 제공하며, 보안을 위한 암호화 저장을 지원합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register API keys for food and exercise APIs, so that I can access external data services securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs the API registration command THEN system SHALL prompt for API provider selection
2. WHEN user selects an API provider THEN system SHALL request the required credentials (API key, endpoint URL, etc.)
3. WHEN user provides valid credentials THEN system SHALL encrypt and store them securely
4. WHEN user provides invalid credentials THEN system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options
5. IF credentials are successfully stored THEN system SHALL confirm registration and test connectivity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage my registered APIs, so that I can monitor their status and update credentials when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests API list THEN system SHALL display all registered APIs with their status
2. WHEN user selects an API to view details THEN system SHALL show connection status, last used time, and configuration
3. WHEN user wants to update API credentials THEN system SHALL allow secure credential modification
4. WHEN user wants to remove an API THEN system SHALL request confirmation and safely delete stored credentials
5. IF API connection fails THEN system SHALL display troubleshooting suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API credentials to be stored securely, so that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are stored THEN system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN system accesses stored credentials THEN system SHALL decrypt them only when needed
3. WHEN credential file is created THEN system SHALL set appropriate file permissions (read-only for owner)
4. IF encryption key is compromised THEN system SHALL provide credential re-encryption functionality
5. WHEN system starts THEN system SHALL verify credential file integrity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test API connections before using them, so that I can ensure they work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests connection test THEN system SHALL attempt to connect to the API endpoint
2. WHEN connection is successful THEN system SHALL display success message with response time
3. WHEN connection fails THEN system SHALL show specific error details and suggested solutions
4. WHEN API has rate limits THEN system SHALL respect them during testing
5. IF API requires specific test endpoints THEN system SHALL use appropriate test calls

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about API status changes, so that I can take action when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API key is about to expire THEN system SHALL notify user in advance
2. WHEN API connection fails repeatedly THEN system SHALL alert user about potential issues
3. WHEN API rate limit is exceeded THEN system SHALL inform user and suggest waiting period
4. WHEN new API version is available THEN system SHALL notify about potential updates needed
5. IF API service is deprecated THEN system SHALL warn user and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure API settings and parameters, so that I can customize the integration according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses API configuration THEN system SHALL display all configurable parameters
2. WHEN user modifies timeout settings THEN system SHALL validate and apply the changes
3. WHEN user sets retry policies THEN system SHALL implement the specified retry behavior
4. WHEN user configures rate limiting THEN system SHALL respect the specified limits
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN system SHALL prevent saving and show validation errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import and export API configurations, so that I can backup settings or share them across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests configuration export THEN system SHALL create encrypted backup file
2. WHEN user imports configuration file THEN system SHALL validate format and decrypt safely
3. WHEN importing existing API configurations THEN system SHALL ask for confirmation before overwriting
4. WHEN export includes sensitive data THEN system SHALL require additional authentication
5. IF import file is corrupted THEN system SHALL display error and preserve existing configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see API usage statistics, so that I can monitor consumption and optimize usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests usage statistics THEN system SHALL display API call counts and success rates
2. WHEN viewing daily usage THEN system SHALL show calls per API with timestamps
3. WHEN approaching rate limits THEN system SHALL display warning with remaining quota
4. WHEN analyzing usage patterns THEN system SHALL provide insights and recommendations
5. IF usage data is unavailable THEN system SHALL explain why and suggest enabling tracking
